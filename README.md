# datafun-03-analytic
This project focuses on reading, processing, and writing different types of data files.

We'll explore Python lists, sets, dictionaries, and tuples. We'll read and write data files including text, csv, JSON, and Excel - and we'll learn a bit of Markdown to format our README.md. We'll use the terminal to fetch content from the web. It's powerful - and easy!
